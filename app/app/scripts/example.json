Over the next couple of months several sprints will occur to release critical updates and more specifically new features. You can leave a ticket or join the conversation at the scheduled times.\nPrimary Images &amp; Galleries Image(s)\nMedia is a fundamental part of commerce, so the Amazon Module will now include support for handling the primary image, in addition to image gallery displays with Owl Carousel support.\nThe 7.x-2.x-dev release updates the Amazon API schema to include support for image galleries.\n\nAmazon Content Type \nThe Amazon API, Amazon Store and Amazon Content Type (coming soon) will communicate more cohesively for enhanced product management. Including features like overriding Product information (Title, Details, Description, Images, etc…) and ready-to-use blocks like “Featured Products” and “Top Sellers”.\nIn other words, when a product on Amazon has a less than desirable description (too short, bad language, incorrect formatting) an administrator will be able to override/append/prepend the description.\n\nThe module includes the following functionality:\nCCK integration via an 'Amazon product' field type\nExtensive Views integration\nSupport for extended Amazon product data (like page counts for books, and MPAA ratings for DVDs)\nQuick-insertion of Amazon item information in node content via an input filter\nSimple search integration\nBasic token support for product data\nAmazon requires that all access to its data use an API key. To use this module, you must sign up for an Amazon API account and request an access key. This process is free, but without it, the module won't do anything.  In addition, if you want to earn money from referrals to Amazon, you will want an Associate ID. Please refer to the documentation for links to the associate page for your locale.\nRelated modules:\nAmazon Store, a complete store with shopping cart\nCall for community contributions\nThis is a community project and improvements/maintenance/support on this take a lot of time.

This is being done as both of these modules override the core menu module to permit non-admin users access to menu functions which form the core of both the Advanced Menu and Bookmarks modules.\nI am presently working on the final touches of the converter code which will convert your Bookmarks installs into Advanced Menu installs. This conversion will work for D6 -&gt; D6 and D6 -&gt; D7 conversions.\nI expect to have this ready soon.\nWhat is the Bookmarks module?\nBookmarks provides a unique (non-shared) menu to each user. The menu can be modified / updated by the individual users and by the site admin (or anyone who has those permissions).  Bookmarks can also be made public and they will appear on the user profile page.  For example, user 1 would have public bookmarks at bookmarks/public/1.\nThe dependency on DHTML Menus has been removed with the 6.x-2.x series.  The latest release of DHTML Menus interfaces directly with the menu system.  The module will continue to function without DHTML Menus but all folders will always be expanded.  To get collapsible folders you will need to install a module that provides this.  DHTML is known to work with this module.\nYou can now specify default bookmarks which will be added to all new users and preset bookmarks which are bookmarks that are defined by the system administrator and can later be added by the user.  For example:\nThe site admin defines a group of presets (\n--Drupal\n----Handbook\n----Patch Spotlight\n----Groups\nInstead of the user having to create this same group they can go to the presets tab and select add folder to have this group added to their bookmarks.\nPatches/code/feedback is always welcomed.\nPlease be sure to read the release notes as they will contain important information about the changes being made.\nThis project sponsored by Brain Heist.",

This is being done <mark>a</mark>s both of these modules override the core menu module to permit non-<mark>a</mark>dmin users <mark>a</mark>ccess to menu functions which form the core of both the <mark>A</mark>dvanced Menu <mark>a</mark>nd Bookmarks modules.\nI <mark>a</mark>m presently working on the final touches of the converter code which will convert your Bookmarks installs into <mark>A</mark>dvanced Menu installs. This conversion will work for D6 -&gt; D6 <mark>a</mark>nd D6 -&gt; D7 conversions.\nI expect to have this ready soon.\nWhat is the Bookmarks module?\nBookmarks provides <mark>a</mark> unique (non-shared) menu to each user. The menu can be modified / updated by the individual users <mark>a</mark>nd by the site <mark>a</mark>dmin (or <mark>a</mark>nyone who has those permissions).  Bookmarks can <mark>a</mark>lso be made public <mark>a</mark>nd they will <mark>a</mark>ppear on the user profile page.  For example, user 1 would have public bookmarks <mark>a</mark>t bookmarks/public/1.\nThe dependency on DHTML Menus has been removed with the 6.x-2.x series.  The latest release of DHTML Menus interfaces directly with the menu system.  The module will continue to function without DHTML Menus but <mark>a</mark>ll folders will <mark>a</mark>lways be expanded.  To get collapsible folders you will need to install <mark>a</mark> module that provides this.  DHTML is known to work with this module.\nYou can now specify default bookmarks which will be <mark>a</mark>dded to <mark>a</mark>ll new users <mark>a</mark>nd preset bookmarks which <mark>a</mark>re bookmarks that <mark>a</mark>re defined by the system <mark>a</mark>dministrator <mark>a</mark>nd can later be <mark>a</mark>dded by the user.  For example:\nThe site <mark>a</mark>dmin defines <mark>a</mark> group of presets (\n--Drupal\n----Handbook\n----Patch Spotlight\n----Groups\nInstead of the user having to create this same group they can go to the presets tab <mark>a</mark>nd select <mark>a</mark>dd folder to have this group <mark>a</mark>dded to their bookmarks.\nPatches/code/feedback is <mark>a</mark>lways welcomed.\nPlease be sure to read the release notes <mark>a</mark>s they will contain important information <mark>a</mark>bout the changes being made.\nThis project sponsored by Brain Heist.",
